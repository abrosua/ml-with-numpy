# Machine Learning with NumPy

These are the simple NumPy implementations for some of the most popular Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, such as:

 1. Linear Regression
 2. Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
 3. k-Nearest Neighbors Regression

## Getting Started
### File Structure

 - `benchmark`--- benchmark scripts
	 - Installing other packages is needed to run the benchmark models (e.g., sklearn's PCA, OLS Regression, and k-NN Regression; statsmodels' Quantile Regression)
 - `demo` --- demo scripts
 - `models` --- scripts for each model

### Built With
[Python 3.6.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-369/), with the following packages:

 - [NumPy 1.17.4](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release/1.17.4-notes.html?highlight=numpy%20generic%20t)
 - *[matplotlib 3.3.0](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.0/users/installing.html)**
 - *[scikit-learn 0.21.3](https://scikit-learn.org/0.21/whats_new.html)** 
 - *[pandas 0.25.0](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.25.0/)**
 - *[statsmodels 0.12.2](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/release/version0.12.2.html)**

> *Note: These packages are NOT required to run the models! Only install it to run the benchmark scripts.

To install the packages, please run the following command,
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
